# Game Launcher (Google Drive Powered)
Designed for Intersect ORPGs, easily distribute game updates to players using your personal Google Drive account.

This is a very basic game updater/launcher for Intersect games and all kinds of projects in general. This updater is open source so you're free to modify it to your liking. Powered by Google drive, you create a google drive folder with your game client. When you add/remove/change files in your google drive folder, the updater will make those same changes for all of your players.

###Step ???:  Releasing Future Update
